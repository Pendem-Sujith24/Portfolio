                <p>
                    Case studies in the cyber domain are essential for understanding real-world security incidents and their impact. They provide insights into how data breaches occur, the methods attackers use, and the strategies organizations employ to respond and recover. Analyzing these cases helps professionals learn best practices, recognize vulnerabilities, and improve overall cybersecurity measures.

                <p>
                    Phishing attacks are deceptive attempts by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details, often through fake emails or websites. Understanding how phishing works helps users recognize suspicious messages and avoid falling victim to these scams.

                <p>
                    A Man In The Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This type of attack can compromise sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal messages. Understanding MITM attacks is crucial for implementing secure communication protocols and protecting data from unauthorized access.

                <h3 style="color:#00b894;"> About Key loggers</h3>
                <p>
                    Key loggers are malicious programs or devices that record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Attackers use key loggers to capture sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers without the user's knowledge. Understanding key loggers is important for recognizing signs of compromise and implementing security measures like antivirus software and strong authentication to protect personal and organizational data.
